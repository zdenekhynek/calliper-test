# Calliper frontend take-home task

In this task you're presented with an API backend of chart data, comments and sharing.
The task is to build a frontend that displays the chart and allows users to add comments and share the chart.

## Running the backend

### Pre-requisites

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

### Installation

Run `docker-compose build` - might take a while for frontend to build.

### Launchnig

Run `docker-compose up` - wait until yo see "frontend | Compiled successfully!" message; loads in around a 2-3 minutes.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

To launch only the backend - run `docker-compose up backend`

## Project structure

`backend` folder hosts FastAPI backend.

- `test_main.py` has integration tests
- `services/test_comments_service.py` has unit tests for thes comments service
- locks are used to prevent race conditions, e.g. multiple comment threads attached to the same chart data point or overwriting the comments

`frontend` folder hosts React/Typescript frontend.

## Domain Model

Bar chart is used for the test task. Countries are on the X axis, Features are on the Y axis.

**Chart Domain**

- `ChartDataPoint` represents single point on the plot
- `ChartDataFeature` is an enum with all available features
- `Country` is an enum with all available features

**Comment Domain**

- `CommentThread` represents a single thread attached to chart
- `Comment` represents an entry within a thread

## Backend API

Backend API runs on http://localhost:8000

### Common backend-exposed type signatures

```typescript
type ChartDataFeature = 'hotdog' | 'burger' | 'sandwitch' | 'kebab' | 'fries' | 'donut';

type Country = 'FR' | 'GB' | 'BE' | 'DE' | 'ES' | 'IT'

type ChartDataPoint = {
  feature: ChartDataFeature;
  country: Country;
}

type CommentThread = {
  id: string;
  comments_count: number;
  chart_data_point: ChartDataPoint[];
}

type Comment = {
  user_name: string;
  text: string;
}
```

### `GET /chart/data`

Returns chart data formatted to be ready-for-consumption.

```typescript
type ChartDataResponse = {
  country: Country;
  [key: ChartDataFeature]: number;
}[]
```

### `GET /chart/comment_threads`

Returns a list of comment threads, 

```typescript
type CommentThreadsResponse = CommentThread[]
```


### `GET /chart/comment_threads/:thread_id`

Returns a list of comments in a thread

```typescript
type CommentThreadResponse = CommentThread & {
    comments: Comment[];
}
```


### `POST /chart/comment_threads`

Creates a new comment thread, responds with `CommentThreadResponse`

```typescript
type CreateThreadRequest = {
  comment: Comment;
  data_point: ChartDataPoint;
}
``
```

### `POST /chart/comment_threads/:thread_id/respond`

Posts a new comment to a thread, responds with `CommentThreadResponse`

```typescript
type RespondToCommentThreadRequest = {
  comment: Comment;
}
``
```

### `GET /share`

Returns a shareable link for a chart

```typescript
type ShareResponse = {
  token: string;
}
```

### `GET /chart/shared/:share_id`

Returns chart data by token, responds with `ChartDataResponse`
